2.write a blog about object and its internal representation in javascript?

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup,
for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is 
made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

Creating Objects in JavaScript:
1.By object literal
2.By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)

By object literal:
The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:
  
         object={property1:value1,property2:value2.....propertyN:value:valueN}

property and valueis separated bycolon(:).

EXAMPLE:
         var person={
         fname:"xxx",
         1name:"yyy",
         age: 25
         };
By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):
The syntax of creating object directly is given below:
         
         var objectname=new Object();

Here, new keyword is used to create object.

EXAMPLE:
         var emp=new Object();
         emp.id=101;
         emp.name="xxx";
         emp.salary=50000;


Accessing JavaScript Objects:
The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:

objectName.property

or

objectName[“property”]

Accessing ‘fname’ from example 1 using dot operator,

          person.fname        
Accessing ‘name’ form example 2 using [],

          emp["name"].
